==> World data is stored under /srv/minecraft
==> The server runs as "minecraft", not root
==> You can access the server's console as root with:
      $ screen -r minecraft
==> The systemd service is called "minecraftd.service"
==> Calling "stop" or "restart" with systemctl will gracefully exit the server, saving world data
==> Modify /etc/conf.d/minecraft to change the invocation of the server if you wish
==> A script at /usr/sbin/minecraftctl is also provided. See the wiki for details on its usage.

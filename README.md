## Archlinux PKGBUILDS

==I may not update this branch as often as I should, since I use pacman-git. If someone wants to start making pull requests that I can merge easily, by all means do so.==

Note, these are not all my work. The `mangle-git` one is, but the others are simply modified by me.

Also, the `*-git` ones only work with pacman-git, so beware. (the `linux-mainline` one does too.)

If you want to use any of these pkgbuilds, I cannot be responsible for anything they might do, and all that nonsense. 

Repo with some packages:

(Currently linux-mailine and pacman-git)

## Archlinux PKGBUILDS

Note, these are not all my work. Most are simply modified by me.

If you want to use any of these pkgbuilds, I cannot be responsible for anything they might do, and all that nonsense. 

There is a separate branch, `linux-mainline-non-git`, that has a linux-mainline PKGBUILD for non-pacman-git users.

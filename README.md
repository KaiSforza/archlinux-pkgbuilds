Archlinux PKGBUILDS

Note, these are not all my work. The `mangle-git` one is, but the others are simply modified by me.

Also, the `*-git` ones only work with pacman-git, so beware. (the `linux-mainline` one does too.)

If you want to use any of these pkgbuilds, I cannot be responsible for anything they might do, and all that nonsense.

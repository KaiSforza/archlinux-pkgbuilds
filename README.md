## Archlinux PKGBUILDS

Note, these are not all my work. Most are simply modified by me.

Also, the `*-git` ones only work with `pacman-git`, so beware. (the `linux-mainline` one does too.)

If you want to use any of these pkgbuilds, I cannot be responsible for anything they might do, and all that nonsense. 

There is a separate branch, `linux-mainline-non-git`, that has a linux-mainline PKGBUILD for non-pacman-git users.

(Currently linux-mailine and pacman-git)
